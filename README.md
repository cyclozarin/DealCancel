# DealCancel

Due to inability to cancel sponsorship in the vanilla game, if you'll take a buggy sponsorship (for example FredGull sponsorship (aka damage sponsorship) will overflow progress if it's greater than sponsorship goal, i.e. 426 damage will become 26 damage in progress when goal is 400 damage), **sponsorship will follow you forever and you will be unable to complete it unless proper bugfix will be released.** 

This mod fixes that problem by adding a button below sponsorship description and progress on sponsorship PC that upon clicking will greet you with modal asking if you are sure to cancel sponsorship or not. **Note that only the host can cancel sponsorship to prevent unwanted sponsorship cancellings.**
